# intro
Wget-2-zim is a simple bash script with some nifty tricks that can be used to archive websites on the internet. It does not require ServiceWorkers and will drop a ZIM file that can be read with Kiwix.

# how to use 

> ./wget-2-zim.sh https://ballerburg.us.to

# notes

I will probably add docker later
